# Links

Markdown supports two styles for creating links: inline and reference. With both styles, you use square brackets to delimit the text you want to turn into a link.

Inline-style links use parentheses immediately after the link text.

Reference-style links allow you to refer to your links by names, which you define elsewhere in your document.
