# Blockquotes

Markdown uses email-style `>` characters for blockquoting.

It looks best if you hard wrap the text and put a `>` before every line. Markdown allows you to be lazy and only put the > before the first line of a hard-wrapped paragraph.

Blockquotes can be nested (i.e. a blockquote-in-a-blockquote) by adding additional levels of `>`. Blockquotes can contain other Markdown elements, including headers, lists, and code blocks.
