Inline code: `print 'hello world'`


Code block:

    100.times do
      puts 'hello world'
    end


Fenced code blocks is very popular too:

```javascript
$(function(){
  console.log('hello world');
});
```


To include a literal backtick character within a code span, you can use multiple backticks as the opening and closing delimiters:

``There is a literal backtick (`) here.``
