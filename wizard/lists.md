# Lists

Unordered (bulleted) lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens (`*`, `+`, and `-`) as list markers.

Ordered (numbered) lists use regular numbers, followed by periods, as list markers.

List items may consist of multiple paragraphs. Each subsequent paragraph in a list item must be indented by either 4 spaces or one tab.

And if you have sub lists, put two extra spaces before the sub list items.
