# Headings

Markdown offers two styles of headings: Setext and atx. 

- Setext-style headings for `h1` and `h2` are created by “underlining” with equal signs `=` and hyphens `-`, respectively. 
- To create an atx-style heading, you put 1-6 hash marks `#` at the beginning of the line — the number of hashes equals the resulting HTML heading level.


Optionally, you may “close” atx-style headers. This is purely cosmetic — you can use this if you think it looks better.  
The closing hashes don’t even need to match the number of hashes used to open the header. (The number of opening hashes determines the header level.)
